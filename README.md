# Programming & Scripting Project

## Author: Paul Callaghan

### Project Name:

Iris Dataset Analysis

### Project Description:

This project is intended to present the Fisher Iris dataset in a meaningful manner using at least a histogram, a scatterplot and a summary text file (with possibly more to be added).
Based on Chapter 3 (section 2) of 'Mark Fenner's Machine Learning with Python for Everyone', the dataset is named after Sir Ronald Fisher, a statistician from the mid-20th century however it was in fact Edgar Anderson that gathered the data. 

In the dataset, there are four measurements per iris - sepal length, sepal width, petal length and petal width (all in centimetres).

The analysis.py script will contain the menu where the user can select from 4 functions or to exit the application.
